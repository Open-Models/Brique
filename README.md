# Open Models - Branch of Knowledge

**\[Branch under construction, see [roadmap](organisation/roadmap.md)\]**

The digital is a new world that we have only just begun to explore.

Due to its capacity for the free circulation of knowledge and large-scale collaboration, unique phenomena are taking shape: open models that form the epicentre of this digital revolution.

Omnipresent, we know almost nothing about them. Open models have already shaped the digital world and could tomorrow help transform society in the face of the crises of the Anthropocene by changing our relationship to knowledge.

The branch of knowledge on open models is intended as a digital common for mastering these new concepts: Open (Source) Software, Open Science, Open Education, Open Hardware, Open Data, Open Innovation, Open Standard, Open Organization...

An openly accessible resource to dive into the digital of knowledge.

## Knowledge of the branch üìñ

The core of the branch consists of a body of knowledge on open models.

Knowledge to discover these phenomena, their histories, develop a methodology for building digital commons, learn how these collaborative dynamics work to seek to make them your own!

A resource to acquire basic open models skills and being an active player in these universes.

**Open models knowledge:**

* [Introduction to open models](content/introduction.md)
* [History of open models](content/history.md)
* [Method for building a digital common](content/method/README.md)
* [List of open models](content/models/README.md)
* [List of projects](content/projects/README.md)

A [list of resources](resources.md) on open models brings together a variety of useful links.

## Workshop materials üìö

Open model education takes many forms and reaches many audiences, a multitude of teaching materials can be created and reused. To help you set up activities, a whole range of open resources can be found on a page dedicated to [materials for open models education workshops](workshop-material.md).

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

To set and understand the orientation of the community around the branch, a [roadmap](organisation/roadmap.md) shows the main axes of work defined.

A collective project, a collaboratively built digital common, open to contribution and hosted (temporarily ü§û) on the non-open-source [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique) platform.

## Contribute üêú

The digital commons are based on an entire culture of contribution. The contributions of each individual contribute to the prosperity of the whole, provided that the ecosystem around a project is able to include external players.

A [contribution guide](organisation/contribution-guidelines.md) explains different ways to help on this branch of knowledge project.

Many ways to participate in this democratization of open models!

## Exchange with the community ü§≥üèº

The [discussion space](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/discussions) allows you to ask questions, go into more detail on certain points or simply chat with other members of the community ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Don't hesitate to share any open models related projects you may have over there, they could be of interest to others people!
